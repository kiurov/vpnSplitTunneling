# VPN split tunneling app for macOS ï£¿

If you need to split internet traffic to access, for example, company resources, you can use this application. All you need to do after connecting to the VPN is to launch the application and select the file that lists the domains to which you need to access through the company VPN. All other traffic will follow the default route.
